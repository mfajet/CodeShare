# CodeShare
Yet another code sharing application. Creating this as a school project.

I'm creating th frontend with tkinter and tkk by using PAGE (Python Automatic GUI Generator) which can be found at http://page.sourceforge.net/

display.py is the PAGE generated python GUI. It will not work properly.
mydisplay.py is the one that will work. I did this because PAGE overwrites changes that I write myself, but adding functionality through PAGE is very difficult.
